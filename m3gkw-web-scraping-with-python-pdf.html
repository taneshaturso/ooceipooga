                            <p>Part I focuses on web scraping mechanics: using Python to request information from a web server, performing basic handling of the server’s response, and interacting with sites in an automated fashion. Part II explores a variety of more specific tools and applications to fit any web scraping scenario you’re likely to encounter. Job is to build a web scraper that gathers information about restaurants including finding their wine list (can be a pdf, HTML, or text) as well as other information about the restaurant (address, type, etc.). The list of restaurants to scrape is not known ahead of time and will instead need to be inferred based on geographical location. The use of APIs such as Yelp will likely be of great help for much of this task but building a custom scraping solution for finding the wine lists Web scraping is becoming increasingly useful as a means to easily gather and make sense of the plethora of information available online. Using a simple language like Python, you can crawl the information out of complex websites using simple programming.This book is the ultimate guide to using Python to scrape data from websites.
